# ðŸ’¤ LazyVim

This is my configuration for [LazyVim](https://www.lazyvim.org).

_Note: My machine is running on Windows therefore some plugins might not work
on other OS._

## Important Notes

- If using Windows Terminal, remember to set the opacity to less then 100
order for the transparent background to work properly.
